# Character files contain character descriptions, preferences, traits, habits, props unique to that 
# particular character (does this character have a quizzing glass through which he stares at people 
# he finds inferior? an umbrella she unfurls in the house?). Character-specific dialogue also goes 
# here: anything that character might have to say about his backstory, amusing incidents that 
# recently happened to him, etc. In the currently available content, for instance, the character of
#  Lucy has certain flirtation actions that are unique to her, but that create openings for 
# relationship change that use the standard underlying mechanisms for changing relationship state. 
# This means that other characters who have unique strategies for responding to flirtation can react 
# appropriately, even if the two characters have not explicitly been coded to interact with one 
# another.
