;Dorn Ironarm, smith (dwarf) [A5]
; Naught that’s strong that doesn’t get stronger under the hammer.

;Dorn is a sturdy, bald-headed, black bearded taciturn dwarf
;smith who has made Oakhurst his home for forty years.
;He’s been a smith all his life, though he longs for greater
;recognition. He counts among his ancestors the great
;dwarven smith Duergeddin, of whom he is quite proud,
;though it takes quite a bit to get him to talk about it. His ale
;is fine, though it takes some smooth talking (Diplomacy DC
;28) or a great favor (a Duergeddin weapon, information
;about the location of Khundrakkar, or information about
;the whereabouts of Mountain Home) to get him to part
;with more than a mug.
